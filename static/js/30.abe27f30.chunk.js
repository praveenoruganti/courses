As the user switches from their laptop to an iPad, the website should automatically switch to accommodate for resolution, image size, and scripting abilities.\n\nOne may also have to consider the settings on their devices; if they have a VPN for iOS on their iPad, for example, the website should not block the user\u2019s access to the page.\n\nIn other words, the website should have the technology to automatically respond to the user\u2019s preferences.\n\nThis would eliminate the need for a different design and development phase for each new gadget on the market.\n\nAnimated GIF of responsive design working\n\n![screenshot of the app](https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/mq-animate.gif)\n\n**Tools for Responsive Web Design**\n\n**What is a media query?**\n\nA media query is a CSS technique introduced in CSS3.\n\nIt uses the @media rule to include a block of CSS properties only if a certain condition is true.\n\nFor example,If the browser window is 600px or smaller, the background color will be lightblue:\n\n```jsx\n@media only screen and (max-width: 600px) {\n  body {\n    background-color: lightblue;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nMedia queries can help with that. We can add a breakpoint where certain parts of the design will behave differently on each side of the breakpoint.\n\n**Desktop**\n\n![screenshot of the app](https://praveenoruganti.github.io/courses/images/css/Desktop.png)\n\n**Phone**\n\n![screenshot of the app](https://praveenoruganti.github.io/courses/images/css/Phone.png)\n "}}]);
