A web application is composed of web components like Servlet, JSP, Filter etc. and other components such as HTML.\nThe web components typically execute in Web Server and respond to HTTP request.\n\n**CGI(Commmon Gateway Interface)**\n\nCGI technology enables the web server to call an external program and pass HTTP request information to the external program to process the request.\nFor each request, it starts a new process.\n\n![screenshot of the app](https://praveenoruganti.github.io/courses/images/servlet/cgi.png)\n\n**Disadvantages of CGI**\n\nThere are many problems in CGI technology:\n\n- If number of clients increases, it takes more time for sending response.\n- For each request, it starts a process and Web server is limited to start processes.\n- It uses platform dependent language e.g. C, C++, perl.\n\n**Advantages of a Servlet**\n\n![screenshot of the app](https://praveenoruganti.github.io/courses/images/servlet/servlet.png)\n\nThere are many advantages of servlet over CGI. The web container creates threads for handling the multiple requests to the servlet.\nThreads have a lot of benefits over the Processes such as they share a common memory area, lightweight, cost of communication between the threads are low.\nThe basic benefits of servlet are as follows:\n\n- Better performance:\ufffdbecause it creates a thread for each request not process.\n- Portability:\ufffdbecause it uses java language.\n- Robust:\ufffdServlets are managed by JVM so we don't need to worry about memory leak, garbage collection etc.\n- Secure:\ufffdbecause it uses java language.\n\n**How Servlet works**\n\nFor every client request to Servlet, a thread will be created by webcontainer and process it accordingly. We need to make sure our application is thread safe as it is a thread base.\nNew request objects will be created to store the data.\n\n![screenshot of the app](https://praveenoruganti.github.io/courses/images/servlet/1.png)\n\n![screenshot of the app](https://praveenoruganti.github.io/courses/images/servlet/2.png)\n\nData transfer between Servlet and JSP is generally done based on request and session objects.\n\n![screenshot of the app](https://praveenoruganti.github.io/courses/images/servlet/3.png)\n\n![screenshot of the app](https://praveenoruganti.github.io/courses/images/servlet/4.png)\n\n\n**Servlet Container**\n\nIt provides the runtime environment for JavaEE (j2ee) applications. The client/user can request only a static WebPages from the server. If the user wants to read the web pages as per input then the servlet container is used in java.\n\nThe servlet container is used in java for dynamically generate the web pages on the server side. Therefore the servlet container is the part of a web server that interacts with the servlet for handling the dynamic web pages from the client.\n\n\n**Web Server**\n\nWeb server contains only web or servlet container. It can be used for servlet, jsp, struts, jsf etc. It can't be used for EJB.\n\n**Application Server**\n\nApplication server contains Web and EJB containers. It can be used for servlet, jsp, struts, jsf, ejb etc.\nIt is a component based product that lies in the middle-tier of a server centric architecture.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n "}}]);
