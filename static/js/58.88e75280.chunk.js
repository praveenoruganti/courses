For example, `Linear Search`.\n- Interval Search: These algorithms are specifically designed for searching in sorted data-structures. These type of searching algorithms are much more efficient than Linear Search as they repeatedly target the center of the search structure and divide the search space in half. For example, `Binary Search`.\n\n**Complexity**\n\n![screenshot of the app](https://praveenoruganti.github.io/courses/images/dsa/searchalgotime.jpg)\n\nYou can learn more about space and time complexity in [further section](https://praveenoruganti.github.io/courses/#/dsa/complexity).\n\n\n "}}]);
