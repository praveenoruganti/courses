An index is small, fast, and optimized for quick lookups. It is very useful for connecting the relational tables and searching large tables. Notice that not only creating a primary key creates a unique SQL index.\n\nFor example,\n\n```jsx\nCREATE TABLE Bookstore\n(ISBN_NO    VARCHAR(15) NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY, \n SHORT_DESC VARCHAR(100), \n AUTHOR     VARCHAR(40), \n PUBLISHER  VARCHAR(40), \n PRICE      FLOAT, \n INDEX SHORT_DESC_IND(SHORT_DESC, PUBLISHER)\n);\n```\n\nLet's see different types of indexes\n\n- Unique Index \n\nThis index does not allow the field to have duplicate values if the column is unique indexed. If primary key is defined, a unique index can be applied automatically.\n\n- Clustered Index\n\nThis index reorders the physical order of the table and searches based on the basis of key values. Each table can only have one clustered index.\n\n- Non-Clustered Index\n\nIt doesn\u2019t alter the physical order of the table and maintain a logical order of the data. Each table can have many non-clustered indexes.\n\n**What is the difference between clustered and non-clustered indexes?**\n\n- One table can have only one clustered index but multiple nonclustered indexes.\n\n- Clustered indexes can be read rapidly rather than non-clustered indexes.\n\n- Clustered indexes store data physically in the table or view and non-clustered indexes do not store data in the table as it has separate structure from the data row.\n\n "}}]);
