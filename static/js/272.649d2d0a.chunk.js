The benefits of testing include preventing bugs, reducing development costs and improving performance.\n\n\nWhen we are developing software projects, there can be many reasons for defects in that software. The developer can also make an error which may result in a defect or bug in the software source code. Any defect or bug in the software will produce wrong results causing a failure. When a bug or defect causes in software application, testing is done to find out the cause of defect and to remove the bug.\n\nAs part of software development if bug introduced, it has to be rectified so that it does not disrupts the whole process of software program. That rectified part is again tested to confirm that it is compatible with the rest of program.\n\nMost common software problems are:\n- Incorrect implementation of the business rules\n- Weak software performance\n- Incorrect results of data searches\n- Incorrect matching of data\n- Inadequate security controls\n- Confusing or misleading data\n- Incorrect file handling, etc.\n\n**Types of software testing**\n\n![screenshot of the app](https://praveenoruganti.github.io/courses/images/testing/tests.jpg)\n\nThere are many different types of software tests, each with specific objectives and strategies:\n\n- Acceptance testing: Verifying whether the whole system works as intended.\n- Integration testing: Ensuring that software components or functions operate together.\n- Unit testing: Validating that each software unit performs as expected. A unit is the smallest testable component of an application.\n- Functional testing: Checking functions by emulating business scenarios, based on functional requirements. Black-box testing is a common way to verify functions.\n- Performance testing: Testing how the software performs under different workloads. Load testing, for example, is used to evaluate performance under real-life load conditions.\n- Regression testing: Checking whether new features break or degrade functionality. Sanity testing can be used to verify menus, functions and commands at the surface level, when there is no time for a full regression test.\n- Stress testing: Testing how much strain the system can take before it fails. Considered to be a type of non-functional testing.\n- Usability testing: Validating how well a customer can use a system or web application to complete a task.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n "}}]);
