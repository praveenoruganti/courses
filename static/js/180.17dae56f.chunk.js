In this diagram, the sequence of interactions between the objects is represented in a step-by-step manner.\n\nSequence diagrams show a detailed flow for a specific use case or even just part of a particular use case. They are almost self-explanatory; they show the calls between the different objects in their sequence and can explain, at a detailed level, different calls to various objects.\n\nA sequence diagram has two dimensions: The vertical dimension shows the sequence of messages in the chronological order that they occur; the horizontal dimension shows the object instances to which the messages are sent.\n\nLet's see Sample sequence diagram for ATM balance inquiry\n\n![screenshot of the app](https://praveenoruganti.github.io/courses/images/objectorienteddesign/sequence-diagram.svg)\n\nA sequence diagram is straightforward to draw. Across the top of your diagram, identify the class instances (objects) by putting each class instance inside a box (see above figure). If a class instance sends a message to another class instance, draw a line with an open arrowhead pointing to the receiving class instance and place the name of the message above the line. Optionally, for important messages, you can draw a dotted line with an arrowhead pointing back to the originating class instance; label the returned value above the dotted line.\n\n**What is the difference between Activity diagram and Sequence diagram?**\n\n**Activity diagram** captures the process flow. It is used for functional modeling. A functional model represents the flow of values from external inputs, through operations and internal data stores, to external outputs.\n\n**Sequence diagram** tracks the interaction between the objects. It is used for dynamic modeling, which is represented by tracking states, transitions between states, and the events that trigger these transitions. "}}]);
