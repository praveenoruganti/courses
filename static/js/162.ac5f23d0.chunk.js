It gives support to iteration and conditional tasks, underpins the tags to control the xml files, it underpins skeleton to the merged existed custom tags.\n\nThe following are the advantages of JSTL.\n\n- It have many tags for fast development which simplifies the JSP.\n- It was used for reusability of the code in various pages.\n- For using JSTL, scriptlet tag can be avoided.\n\nThe JSTL tags can be classified, according to their functions, into following JSTL tag library groups that can be used when creating a JSP page:\n\n- Core Tags\t: used for import,if, foreach loops\n- Formatting tags : used for formatting text, Date,number,URLencoding\n- SQL tags : used for SQL operations like INSERT,SELECT., etc\n- XML tags : provides support for XML processing\n- JSTL Functions : provides support for string manipulation.\n\n![screenshot of the app](https://praveenoruganti.github.io/courses/images/jsp/jstl.jpg)\n\n**Core tags**\n\nCore tags provide variable support, flow control and URL administration and so on\n\nThe following is the syntax to represent core tags.\n\n```jsx\n<%@ taglib uri="http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/core" prefix="c" %>\n```\n\n![screenshot of the app](https://praveenoruganti.github.io/courses/images/jsp/jstlcore.jpg)\n\n\n**Function Tags**\n\nFunction tags gives support for sting manipulation and the URL tag is http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/functions and where fn is the prefix.\n\n![screenshot of the app](https://praveenoruganti.github.io/courses/images/jsp/jstlfunction.jpg)\n\n**SQL Tags**\n\nProvides SQL support and the URL for SQL tag is http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/sql and where prefix is sql.\n\n![screenshot of the app](https://praveenoruganti.github.io/courses/images/jsp/jstlsql.jpg)\n\n**Internationalization Tags / Formatting tags**\n\nThe tag gives backing to message formating, number and date designing and the url\'s tag is http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/fmt and where fmt is the prefix.\n\n![screenshot of the app](https://praveenoruganti.github.io/courses/images/jsp/jstlin.jpg)\n\n\n\n '}}]);
