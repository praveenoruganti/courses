The database is divided into two or more tables and relationships are defined between them.\n\nLet's see different types of Normal Forms.\n\n- **First Normal Form**: Every record is unique in a table and is identified by a primary or a composite key\n- **Second Normal Form**: The table must be in First Normal Form and it should have a single column as its primary key\n- **Third Normal Form**: The table must be in Second Normal Form and must have no transitive functional dependencies. I.e a non-key column must not be dependent on another non-key column within the same table\n\n**What is de-normalization and when do you go for it?**\n\nDe-normalization is a technique sometimes used to improve performance so the table design allows redundant data to avoid complex joins. If the application involves heavy read operations then de-normalization is used at an expense of the write operations performance. "}}]);
