JSP supports 3 types of directive elements, they are\n- Page directive\n- Include directive\n- Taglib directive\n\nSyntax of directive elements\n\n<@ directive attribute="value" %>\n\n`Page Directive`\n\nThe page directive defines attributes that apply to an entire JSP page. This element is used to define default of explicit operation to the jsp.\n\nSyntax\n\n<@ page attribute="value"%>\n\nAttributes of JSP page directive\n- import\n- contentType\n- extends\n- language\n- buffer\n- info\n- isELIgnored\n- isThreadSafe\n- autoFlush\n- session\n- pageEncoding\n- errorPage\n- isErrorPage\n\n`JSP Include Directive`\nIt is used to include some other pages into the JSP document, It may be JSP file, html file or text file. This is known as static include because the target page is located and included at the time of page compilation.\n\nThe jsp page is translated only once so it will be better to include static resource.\n\nAdvantage of Include directive\n\nCode Re-usability\n\nSyntax of Include directive elements\n\n```jsx\n<%@ include file="resourceName"%>\nFor Example\n<html>\n<body>\n<%@ include file="footer.html" %>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n**Note**: The include directive includes the original content, so the actual page size grows at run-time.\n\n`Taglib Directive`\n\nThis is used to use custom tags in JSP page, here the custom tag may be user defined ot JSTL tag or struts, JSF,..... etc.\n\nSyntax\n\n<@ taglib uri="uriofthetaglibrary" prefix="prefixoftaglibrary" %>\n\nAttributes of taglib directive\n\n- uri\n\nFor example\n\nheading2.tag\n\n![screenshot of the app](https://praveenoruganti.github.io/courses/images/jsp/heading2.tag.jpg)\n\ntaglib.jsp\n\n![screenshot of the app](https://praveenoruganti.github.io/courses/images/jsp/taglib.jsp.jpg)\n\n![screenshot of the app](https://praveenoruganti.github.io/courses/images/jsp/jspdemo4.jpg)\n\n '}}]);
