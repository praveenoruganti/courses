Whichever member is public, then that name only can be used for saving the .java file.If enum is public, then that .java file should be saved as enum name.\n- enum improves type safety\n- enum can be easily used in switch\n- enum may implement many interfaces but cannot extend any class because it internally extends Enum class\n\n**Sample Code**\n\n```jsx\n\nenum Month {\n    JAN, FEB, MAR, APR, MAY, JUN, JUL, AUG, SEPT, OCT, NOV, DEC\n}\npublic class Enum {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Month m3 = Month.MAR;\n        System.out.println("m3 : " + m3);\n        Month m5 = Month.MAY;\n        System.out.println("m5 : " + m5);\n        System.out.println("7th month : " + Month.JUL);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Output**\n\nm3 : MAR\n\nm5 : MAY\n\n7th month : JUL\n\n\n\n '}}]);
